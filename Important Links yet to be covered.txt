/***************************************************************************************************************************/

Optimizing SQL query performance is crucial for ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation in database systems. Here are several ways to optimize SQL queries:

1. Use Indexes Wisely:

	=> Indexes help in faster data retrieval by providing quick access to rows in a table. Proper indexing of columns involved in 		   search conditions (WHERE clauses), JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses can significantly enhance query performance.

	=> However, over-indexing can lead to increased storage requirements and slower write operations, so indexes should be used 		   judiciously.

2. Optimize Queries:

	=> Simplify queries by eliminating unnecessary joins, conditions, and columns.

	=> Rewrite complex queries to use efficient techniques like EXISTS, IN, and JOINs rather than subqueries.

3. Avoid SELECT * and Use Specific Columns:

	=> Fetching only the required columns instead of using SELECT * can reduce the amount of data transmitted between the database 	   server and the client, resulting in faster query execution.

4. Use Proper JOINs:

	=> Choose the appropriate type of JOIN (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN) based on the relationship between the tables 	   and the desired result set.

	=> Use INNER JOIN when only matching rows from both tables are needed.

5. Limit Data Retrieval:

	=> Use the LIMIT keyword to restrict the number of rows returned by the query, especially for queries that return large result 	   sets.
	=> Employ pagination techniques to retrieve data in smaller chunks.

6. Optimize Subqueries:

	=> Replace correlated subqueries with JOINs or derived tables whenever possible, as correlated subqueries can be performance-	   intensive.

7. Avoid Using Cursors:

	=> Cursors should be avoided whenever possible, as they operate row by row, leading to slower performance compared to set-	   based operations.

8. Optimize WHERE Clause:

	=> Ensure that WHERE clauses are sargable (Search ARGument ABLE). Sargable queries can use indexes effectively, whereas non-	  	   sargable queries may require full table scans.

	=> Avoid using functions on indexed columns in WHERE clauses, as it prevents the use of indexes.

9. Monitor Query Performance:

	=> Use database monitoring tools to analyze query execution plans and identify performance bottlenecks.

	=> Monitor and optimize long-running queries to improve overall system performance.

10. Use Stored Procedures:

	=> Stored procedures can improve performance by reducing network traffic and pre-compiling SQL statements.

	=> They can also be optimized and cached by the database engine for faster execution.

11. Consider Denormalization:

	=> In some cases, denormalizing the database by adding redundant data can improve query performance by reducing the need for 	   complex joins.

	=> However, denormalization should be approached cautiously to maintain data integrity and consistency.

12. Database Optimization:

	=> Regularly perform database maintenance tasks such as index rebuilding, updating statistics, and defragmenting data files to 	   ensure optimal performance.

	=> By implementing these optimization techniques, you can significantly enhance the performance of your SQL queries and 	   improve the overall efficiency of your database system.

1️⃣ Ride Booking Application - Asked in Google: The focus here was on the importance of geospatial data in an Uber-like app. Designing a Data Warehouse that efficiently stores, processes, and queries Lat-Long data to provide insights into ride patterns, optimal routing, and driver allocation was a deep dive into spatial data complexities. 

2️⃣ The IPL Tournament - Asked in Flipkart: Design a data model to capture the vibrancy and complexity of an IPL tournament. The task was to craft a schema that could offer insights into team performances, player stats, match outcomes, and more, all while being efficient and scalable. 

3️⃣ Meeting Management System - Asked in Uber : Ever thought about the intricacies behind booking meeting rooms? This question required designing a data model that not only keeps track of room availability and bookings but also dynamically updates slots based on actual usage, a real test of flexibility and real-time data handling. 

4️⃣ Food Delivery Application - Asked in Grab : This scenario explored designing a warehouse capable of analyzing order delivery times, customer preferences, restaurant performance, and more, for a food delivery platform. A delicious mix of consumer behavior analysis and logistical optimization!

5️⃣ Vehicle Rental Service like Zoomcar - Asked in Atlassian : The question was to design a data warehouse that tracks vehicle rentals, usage patterns, maintenance schedules, and customer feedback. It was an exciting exercise in balancing asset management with customer satisfaction. 

P.S: Small note based on my experience, no one looks for 100% accurate answer so approach the questions accordingly 🙂













Amazon Business Analyst Assignment Questions ➖

Question 1 - Scenario: You are a data analyst at an online bookstore. The `Product_Orders` table logs each order made, uniquely identified by an `order_id`, along with the associated `product_id`, `unit_price`, and `order_timestamp`. The `Order_Status` table tracks changes in status for each order with a corresponding status `timestamp`.

Status Definitions:
- PLACED: The order has been made by the customer.
- SHIPPED: The order has been dispatched from the warehouse.
- DELIVERED: The order has been received by the customer.
- REFUSED: The customer refused the order at delivery.
- RETURNED: The order was returned by the customer after accepting it.

Objective: Calculate the Total Sales Value Difference month-on-month.

Formula:
- Total Sales Value Difference = Sum(unit price of DELIVERED orders) - Sum(unit price of REFUSED orders) - Sum(unit price of RETURNED orders), calculated monthly.

Data Samples:

| 1007     | 2023-03-05 11:00 | 507        | 40         |

`Order_Status` Table:

| order_id | timestamp        | status     |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| 1001     | 2023-01-16 14:00 | SHIPPED    |
